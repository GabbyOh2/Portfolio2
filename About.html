                <h2>A Little About Me...</h2>
                <p>I have spent 2 years at a community college learning science to prepare for medical school. However, I decided to persue my original interest which was in design/art so I decided to transfer to Georgia Tech, a school well known for engineering and computer science. I was sure they had the right resources for me to strengthen my skill sets.</p>
